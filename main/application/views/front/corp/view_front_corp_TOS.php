	<h3>
	1. WHAT WE DO
	</h3>
	
	ClubbingOwl provides the Services to USER for the purpose of assisting USER in securing entry to participating third party bars, lounges, clubs and other venues (each a “Venue”) by, among other methods, helping the USER reserve an entry on the guest list of another third party (“Promoter”) at such Venues. In response to a USER’s online request, the ClubbingOwl Site may contact the applicable Promoter, or the applicable Venue directly, to reserve for the USER an entry on the appropriate guest list at the Venue. The availability of space on a guest list is determined at the time of USER’s query. Once a reservation on a guest list is made by USER, ClubbingOwl will provide confirmation of the reservation to USER by email, text or a Facebook message, or through other appropriate electronic mechanism. By using the Services, USER agrees to receive reservation confirmations by email, text or a Facebook message, or other appropriate electronic mechanism, after booking a reservation through the ClubbingOwl Site.	
	
	<h3>
	2. PRIVACY POLICY
	</h3>
	
	ClubbingOwl is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. ClubbingOwl does not share USER’s Facebook user-name with the Venues, Promoters, or any other third party. ClubbingOwl will, however, provide Venues and Promoters the ability to send messages to you through ClubbingOwl, which will be delivered by ClubbingOwl’s software to you via email, text or a Facebook message. We will store basic information about you that you provide to us such as your name, e-mail address, etc. We will also store information related to your use of the ClubbingOwl Site and the Services. We may also access and store data about you that is made available through Facebook, such as your profile picture or its URL, your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo, the user ID numbers and other public data for your friends, your physical location and that of your access devices, your gender and your birthday. We will not sell or provide any personally identifiable information about you to any third parties, other than your name and other information you provide to the pertinent Promoters or Venues in connection with any reservations you make using the Services.
	
	<h3>
	3. USAGE GUIDELINES
	</h3>
	
	The Services are being offered to USER for USER’s personal use. USER agrees to use the Services only to book reservations at participating Venues and through participating Promoters and then honor those reservations by arriving at the Venue(s) on time and paying any applicable cover charge as well as ordering and paying for libations and/or food once inside the Venue, in accordance with the terms of the reservation made by the USER and the applicable policies of the Venue. Resale or attempted resale of reservations is prohibited, and is grounds for, among other things, cancellation. ClubbingOwl expressly reserves all its rights and remedies under applicable state and federal law. Any and all other uses which are unlawful or in violation of this Agreement’s terms and conditions are prohibited. ClubbingOwl reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel reservations.

You can opt out of receiving emails, Facebook messages and text messages by going to your profile page within ClubbingOwl (located at the top right hand side corner of our homepage http://www.ClubbingOwl.com).
